            We're not yet committed to a particular MOOC platform provider, though we've spoken to OpenLearning and
            Canvas.net.  We're also contemplating running the course in the open, on this site, using a <a>static apps</a>
            approach to bring the activity here, rather than inside a MOOC platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'd like some features that many MOOC providers do not have (or have not had until recently):

            <ul>
                <li>LTI so we can integrate the critiques</li>
                <li>Support for groups</li>
                <li>
                    A closely integrated social stream, so that content recommended by the groups during the project
                    is properly part of the course, not just an add-on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Preferably) live interaction community on that page. Chat to your class and your group,
                    not just "users you've followed".
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Preferably) presence and status indicators for groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Preferably) CORS and embedding support, so the course can live out here in the open.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            "In case of fire", we've been writing a very small platform of our own, which is open source at
            <a href="//github.com/impressory/impressory">github.com/impressory/impressory</a>.
