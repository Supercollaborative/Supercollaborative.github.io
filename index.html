        <p>
            The course takes students who've been introduced to programming or design, and teaches them how to work with others to build things that are bigger than they can build themselves. Version control, continuous integration, test driven development, API design, all the fun of the fair.
        </p>

        <p>
            We put teams of students on "supercollaborative" projects. Ten students to a team, and fifty teams to each project. Yes, that's 500 students working on each codebase. Don't worry, we've done this before. Well, ok, we've done 140 students on a codebase before. But that's still a decent sized project and we think they've worked well.
        </p>

        <p>
            We don't just throw students in at the deep end and watch them flounder. Alongside the project are videos and tutorials teaching them what they need to know to succeed. And there are systems, communities, and regular peer critiques to help keep projects in shape and on track. The projects get underway in week 4, so students don't have to hit the ground running, and groups can already see who's active.</p>

        <p>By the end of the course, students haven't just got a certificate, they've also built something pretty cool. In 2013, our on-campus students built a Steam-like games arcade, complete with achievements, multiplayer, action replay, and lots of games. Not bad for their second programming course.

  <h1>Our story</h1>

  <p>
    Last year, in Design Computing Studio 2 at The University of Queensland, we put 140 students onto a project to develop
    a networked games arcade (a little like Steam). We gave the students a very small amount of code to start with, and over
    the course of semester the class made 4,883 commits and wrote 67,900 lines of code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The students worked "supercollaboratively". They were in small collaborative teams of four or five students, but
    with thirty groups collaborating on a single project, building different features for the system. The project work was supported by
    GitHub, continuous integration, and static analysis tools giving regular build metrics. These are all regular features of
    real world projects, but this level of collaboration is not commonly how undergraduate students have been taught.
  </p>

  <p>
    As this was a teaching course, of course we also supported the project with studio sessions and interactive teaching in class.
  </p>

  <p>
    And it worked. Our students wrote games, networked multiplayer, event recording and logging, common UI overlays,
    achievement systems, and many more features. When our students graduate and interview for professional roles, if the interviewer asks
    about a project they've worked on, they will have quite a tale to tell.

  <p>
    This wasn't the first time we've taught this course.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few years ago, we were dissatisfied with how undergraduates around the world are taught software engineering.
    Although some universities taught practices like version control and continuous integration, students worked on projects
    that were so small they could essentially do all their coordination and collaboration just by chatting to each other.
    The students weren't encountering the challenges of professional software development, so how could we expect them
    to understand the techniques we use to address them?
  <p>

  <p>
    It is when someone you don't chat to every day starts modifying your code and pushing the changes to you
    that you discover the value of good tests and version control.
    It is when people outside your small group consume your code that you discover the value of good API design.
    It is when you are working on a busy project with a fast-moving codebase that you discover what "merge hell" is and
    how to avoid it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So in 2011, the University of Queensland bravely let us <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au/pub?id=5386">redesign their software studio course</a> to put all the students (nineteen groups of four)
    onto the same codebase. That year, we gave them a large legacy codebase to start from: Robocode. And we gave
    the groups different features to develop that we knew would need to interact with each other.
    This would be a project where students would need to put what we were teaching into practice in order to succeed.
    With seventy students on a project, you can't just get away with chatting to each other.
    And by and large, the students did succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, we had also asked the students to research and present half of the teaching content, which they didn't like, and our
    story for how we were going to mark their work wasn't as clear as it could have been.
    The course worked in principle, but there was work to be done.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2012, we ran the course again. We solved the marking problem and replaced the student presentations with interactive
    sessions where we'd introduce students to the different tools and techniques they would need.
    And this time we let the groups themselves come up with the features they were going to implement.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au/pub?id=6606">The course became even more cooperative</a>, as groups had to talk to each other right from the beginning to
    come up with a feature that could interact with other groups, but would not be completely dependent on another team's
    success. Again, the students succeeded, but this time with fewer bumps and bruises along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2013, our class size doubled. The course changed from "Software Studio" to "Design Computing Studio 2",
    a compulsory course not just for software engineers but also for multimedia design and information systems students.
    So, our cohort became larger and more varied. And this year we ditched the legacy codebase.
    Instead, we gave them a small amount of code to start from, a project structure, the build infrastructure, and a
    mission. <em>We're building a networked games arcade using libgdx. Let's get started.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Again cooperation within the class improved, as they had much greater control over the architecture of the system
    as well as its features.
  </p>

  <p>
    So now, we're keen to take this course out to the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    On campus, the participants are all undergraduate students.<br/>
    Online, cohorts are much more varied, and we hope there can be more peer-to-peer learning and mentoring within the groups.
  </p>

  <p>
    On campus, we have to choose a single project, language, and build system for our 140-odd students.<br/>
    Online, with your help, we can run projects in different languages simultaneously, so it does not need to be
    one-size-fits-all.
  </p>

  <p>
    On campus, we have the usual constraints of a course supported by a couple of teachers and a few tutors, and the
    systems that we can write or maintain. <br/>
    Online, students have resources of the world at their disposal, and the computing
    community can come together to support and grow the course.
  </p>

  <p>
    We think that doing this will bring students closer to professional practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a tech company wondering where you're going to find the next generation of skilled and skillful programmers, then surely working with them
    in their project course is going to help you ensure they know the skills you need, and help you discover a few you'd
    really like to hire.
    If you're an engineer looking to step up and lead or mentor a team, then what better way to start than by helping
    students to learn their trade?
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are a teacher, an engineer, a designer, a marketer, or whether you just want to take part, we think there
    is a way that you can contribute, and benefit, from this endeavour.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, in the interests of building engagement, allow me to close by asking you this:

  <h1>How you can help</h1>
  <p>
    We've taught this course on campus at The University of Queensland since 2011.
    But even on campus we make a point of using cloud services, and reminding students that there's much more useful content out there than just what we produce.
    So as we take it online, we want it to be bigger than just us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surely, if we're teaching students the collaborative nature of programming, we should do it collaboratively.
  </p>

      <h2>Project</h2>
      <p>
      On campus, we use GitHub and Jenkins for hosting the student project. But if you're a cloudy collaboration
      company and would like to help out, we'd love to hear from you.
      </p>
      <p>
      And if you're just a more experienced software engineer (more experienced than a student), we
      think it'd be pretty cool if you joined a team and helped mentor them.

      <p>

      <p>
      The tutorials will be a mixture of in-page exercises.  We'd like to hook many of the in-page exercises up to smart back-ends. For instance, many of which are already out there in other courses.

      We're not yet wedded to a MOOC provider like edX or Coursera. We'll put the course in one when we're ready to go, but we're going to need some things that they haven't got yet. 
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, group-based peer critiques. We're going to try to do these open source, so we've set up a ticket
