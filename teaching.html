            On campus, we teach the course with live demo/lectures, studio time, peer reviews, and a lot of cloud online tools.
            <a href="//impressory.com/course/51fded72790e4323001a50b7/activity">Last year's teaching content</a> is still online, though the system
            is undergoing some changes.

                <p>The course is designed around the projects, which take place <a href="/platform.html">in the cloud
                   on various services</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also means the teaching software will need to support groups and group collaboration.

                    Conceptual videos that can be reused

                    Small exercises will be interspersed with the videos. Many
                    will require the student to do something off-line in a real tool, and come
                    back to answer the question.

        <h1>First Three weeks</h1>

        <p>
            At the start of the course, we give the teams a small amount of code (setting up a project structure), and a
            mission. The students need to get and understand the code, and understand how to contribute changes to it. And that
            means there's a little bit of individual work before the project begins.

        <h2>Distributed version control</h2>

        <p>
            At the end of week 3, teams form and the project begins. From this point on, the course material is to help
            improve how you students work on the project.

        <h1>Project endgame</h1>
        <p>
            As we enter the last couple of weeks, the teaching content is unlikely to make its way into the student projects
            (because they're almost finished). So we focus on more general topics that might feed into future projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Memory and garbage collection</h2>
        <p>Looking inside the VM using VisualVM</p>

        <h2>JVM and bytecode</h2>
        <p>
            On campus, we teach the course in Java, which gives us great tooling to watch how the code is optimised.
        </p>

        <h2>Profiling</h2>
        <p>
            The students' project has no live customers, so never faces performance issues. But here we start to look at
            how to debug performance
        </p>

        <h2>Immutable data and functional programming principles</h2>
        <p>
            Even in an imperative language, we find it valuable to teach about immutable data, thread-safety, futures,
            and monads.

        <h1>Critiques and demo</h1>

        <p>
            As the project progresses, there will be a number of studio style peer critiques.  We find these are valuable
            both for the subject (receiving feedback) and the critic (learning from looking at others' work).
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2013, there was a mid-point critique, and a final demo day. In 2014, we're increasing the number of critiques.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll also be maintaining a social stream where students and groups can post useful content into the course
            while it runs.
