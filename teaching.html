        <h1>Format</h1>

        <p>
            The course is designed around the project, with two teaching streams to support it: planned content
            that we (collaboratively) create, and social content that is brought in during the course itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            That said, we recognise that some students might just follow the teaching content, or the community,
            without taking part in a project. So we will ensure the course remains useful to these students too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Content will be developed and posted here, in the open. This site is a <a href="//github.com/supercollaborative/supercollaborative">GitHub repository</a>
            allowing us to work with it using tickets, pull requests, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tentative plan is that when the course runs, this site transforms from the place where the course is built, to the
            place where it takes place. (By wiring the interaction we need into the site, in the manner of a <a href="//www.staticapps.org/">static app</a>)

        <h1>First Three weeks</h1>

        <p>
            At the start of the course, we give the teams a small amount of code (setting up a project structure), and a
            mission. The students need to get and understand the code, and understand how to contribute changes to it. And that
            means there's a little bit of individual work before the project begins.

            At the end of week 3, teams form and the project begins. From this point on, the course material is to help

        <h1>Critiques and demo</h1>

        <p>
            As the project progresses, there will be a number of studio style peer critiques.  We find these are valuable
            both for the subject (receiving feedback) and the critic (learning from looking at others' work).
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll also be maintaining a social stream where students and groups can post useful content into the course
            while it runs.
